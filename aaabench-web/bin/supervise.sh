# WHY THIS EXISTS. run-agent.sh survives a lot on its own: it waits out usage limits, retries
# transient API failures without spending a nudge, and resumes after every clean stop until its
# nudge budget runs out. But when that budget IS spent, or the script itself dies, the machine
# goes idle until a human notices — which, on an overnight run, means hours. This closes that
# hole. Nothing here needs an interactive session, a terminal, or anyone listening.
#
# It deliberately does NOT pass RESUME_NOTE. The note carries one-off direction ("do these two
# first"); re-issuing it on every relaunch for hours would keep pointing the agent at work it has
# already finished. A plain resume tells it to continue where it left off, which is what is wanted.
